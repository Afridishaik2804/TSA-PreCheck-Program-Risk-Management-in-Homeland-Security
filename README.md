#TSA PreCheck: A Case Study in Homeland Security Risk Management ‚úàÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏è

Have you ever wondered how airport security balances safety with efficiency? The TSA PreCheck program is a great example of risk management in action. This project analyzes how TSA identifies low-risk travelers, speeds up their screening, and allows security teams to focus on passengers who might pose a higher risk.

The study also explores challenges such as limited data, evolving security threats, and privacy concerns, while highlighting opportunities to improve data analysis, collaboration with airlines, and communication with the public. TSA PreCheck demonstrates how smart, risk-based strategies can make security both effective and convenient.
